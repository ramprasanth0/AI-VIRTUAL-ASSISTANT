# AI-VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT
The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for all operating systems. Friday draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands. As a personal assistant, Friday assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in google, bing or yahoo, searching for videos , retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks.
